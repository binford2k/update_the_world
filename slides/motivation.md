* Inertia
    * Resistance to change is a real thing
    * Why upgrade when it works fine?
* Reward
    * New features.
    * Works better/faster/safer.

* Often upgrades offer nothing but the chance to make mistakes and break things!

# Motivation for change
## Or not.

* Inertia
    * Effectively a CONSTANT for any given community.
    * Little control over this value.
* Reward
    * The amount of reward we can offer in a new release is finite.
    * Users want new exciting features, but without changing anything.
    * Ultimately, little control over this value either.

~~~SECTION:notes~~~

* Inertia:
    * Early adopters have very low inertia and are happy to chase the bleeding edge.
    * Late adopters or enterprise customers value stability and resist change.
    * The only way we can control *inertia* is by targeting a different community.
    * Education doesn't change what the institution values.
* Reward:
    * The cost of adding new features grows exponentially as a project matures.
    * Often we pay for it in stability, which ends up as a detractor again.
    * And there are limits to what we can build in any given release cycle.

.callout.warning Ultimately, this means that the differential between inertia
and reward for a minor upgrade cycle is effectively fixed and pretty small.
