## Or not.

* Inertia
    * Effectively a CONSTANT for any given community.
    * Little control over this value.
* Reward
    * The amount of reward we can offer in a new release is finite.
    * It's never going to wash your car or do your laundry.
    * Ultimately, little control over this value either.

~~~SECTION:notes~~~

* Inertia:
    * Early adopters have very low inertia and are happy to chase the bleeding edge.
    * Late adopters or enterprise customers value stability and resist change.
    * The only way we can control *inertia* is by targeting a different community.
    * Education doesn't change what the institution values.
* Reward:
    * The cost of adding new features grows exponentially as a project matures.
    * Often we pay for it in stability, which ends up as a detractor again.
    * And there are limits to what we can build in any given release cycle.
