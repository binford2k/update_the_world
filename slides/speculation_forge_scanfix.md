# Forge tie ins?
## The Forge is rad. Can we make it moreso?

* Maybe opt-in on Forge profile page.
* Instead of scraping GitHub, let authors choose.
* Alerts for out-of-date platform or Puppet dependencies.
    * Shoot, maybe we could even validate for you.
    * Generate tested platform support instead of requiring you declare it.
* Warnings when modules you depend on are updated.
