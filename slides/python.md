.callout.quote We did not want to hurt the people using Python 2. So, in 2008,
we announced that we would sunset Python 2 in 2015, and asked people to upgrade
before then. Some did, but many did not. So, in 2014, we extended that sunset
till 2020.

## Postponed sunset date of *January 1, 2020*

~~~SECTION:notes~~~

* From the release of 3.0 to the ultimate retiring of the legacy 2.0 line is TWELVE YEARS.
