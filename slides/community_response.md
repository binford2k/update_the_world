Some were sort of neutral:

.callout.quote Cute idea, however I‚Äôm not going to merge it unless someone
gives it a smoke test at least.

Some were very positive:

.callout.quote I love this initiative by @binford2k ‚ù§Ô∏è #puppetize #opensource

But the two biggest annoyances were:

1. My fork detection didn't work properly and it contributed PRs to forks
   instead of just upstream projects.
1. It created detached pull requests, which meant that module owners couldn't
   just add to the PR to get a self-contained function port. They had to *merge it*
   and then add more commits to flesh it out.

Also, nobody asked or suggested it, but I should have DCO signed the commits.
