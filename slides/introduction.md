* Hi, I'm Ben, aka binford2k on the interwebs.
* I push the bits and talk to the people at Puppet and in our community.
* If you've been around long enough, then I've probably told you to *just fucking
  upgrade already* at some point, so in keeping with tradition, I'll be doing that
  again today.
* But this time I'm talking about ways that we are working to make it easier for you.
