## Drivers or blockers to change

![.omnigraffle Upgrade ramp](/_images/upgrade_ramp1.png)

* We showed the rewards already.
* Elimination of some major pain points.
* But the module author doesn't necessarily have those pain points.
* And the end user doesn't always *see* the benefits.

.callout.info Inertia is constant and significant. And rewards are actually
quite small.

~~~SECTION:notes~~~

* Any change is more work than doing nothing at all.
    * We don't update just to upgrade.
    * If it already works, upgrading without improvements is just a opportunity to break something.
* The differential between the cost of upgrading and the benefits of upgrading is vanishingly small.
* This means that we have a very small window to provide incentives to upgrade.
    * Which is why people are still using Python 2.7.
