# Community Engagement
## Developer to developer

* Authenticity is key.
* Reaching out to your users is *always* valued.
    * Maybe it actually helped improve someone's code.
    * Or it just provided a reminder to do it.
    * Or even didn't help directly, but showed someone *how* to do it.
* Even in the worst case, it's a signal that we care.
* This connection keeps us all invested in each other and our community.

.callout.cheers I'm grateful to all of you and to the culture we have built here.
Even when a contribution isn't perfect, it's recognized and valued as a genuine
desire to help improve things. I credit [**Vox Pupuli**](https://voxpupuli.org) for a lot of that.
