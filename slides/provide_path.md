### Other irons in the fire now.

* Rangefinder code change impact analysis
    * What downstream usage could a pull request affect?
* Content usage telemetry project
    * How many people are using which classes and types from your modules and on what platforms?
    * For this, I'll need your help socializing so people adopt it.

.callout.heart Most importantly, both of these tools are powered by *open datasets*
that are finally just weeks from going public. You'll be able to use the same
data to invent other tooling.
