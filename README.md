# Node Encrypt Deferred Functions presentation

This is a Showoff presentation. The content is stored in `slides/*`.

To view the presentation, you'll need Docker installed. After installing it, 
run the following command:

```
$ rake preview
```

If you change the content, press `r` to reload it.
(it's cached so just reloading the browser isn't enough)

You can also directly install Showoff and run `showoff serve` if you'd like.
